module VestalVersions
  # An extension module for the +has_many+ association with versions.
  module Versions
    # Returns all versions between (and including) the two given arguments. See documentation for
    # the +at+ extension method for what arguments are valid. If either of the given arguments is
    # invalid, an empty array is returned.
    #
    # The +between+ method preserves returns an array of version records, preserving the order
    # given by the arguments. If the +from+ value represents a version before that of the +to+
    # value, the array will be ordered from earliest to latest. The reverse is also true.
    def between(from, to)
      from_number, to_number = number_at(from), number_at(to)

    # Returns a single version associated with the given value. The following formats are valid:
    # * A Date or Time object: When given, +to_time+ is called on the value and the last version
    #   record in the history created before (or at) that time is returned.
    # * A Numeric object: Typically a positive integer, these values correspond to version numbers
    #   and the associated version record is found by a version number equal to the given value
    #   rounded down to the nearest integer.
    # * A String: A string value represents a version tag and the associated version is searched
    #   for by a matching tag value. *Note:* Be careful with string representations of numbers.
    # * A Symbol: Symbols represent association class methods on the +has_many+ versions
    #   association. While all of the built-in association methods require arguments, additional
    #   extension modules can be defined using the <tt>:extend</tt> option on the +versioned+
    #   method. See the +versioned+ documentation for more information.
    # * A Version object: If a version object is passed to the +at+ method, it is simply returned
    #   untouched.

    # Returns the version number associated with the given value. In many cases, this involves
    # simply passing the value to the +at+ method and then returning the subsequent version number.
    # Hoever, for Numeric values, the version number can be returned directly and for Date/Time
    # values, a default value of 1 is given to ensure that times prior to the first version
    # still return a valid version number (useful for reversion).
