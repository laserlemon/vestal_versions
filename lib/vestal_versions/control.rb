    # Control blocks are called on ActiveRecord::Base instances as to not cause any conflict with
    # other instances of the versioned class whose behavior could be inadvertently altered within
    # a control block.
    # The +skip_version+ block simply allows for updates to be made to an instance of a versioned
    # ActiveRecord model while ignoring all new version creation. The <tt>:if</tt> and
    # <tt>:unless</tt> conditions (if given) will not be evaulated inside a +skip_version+ block.
    #
    # When the block closes, the instance is automatically saved, so explicitly saving the
    # object within the block is unnecessary.
    #
    # == Example
    #
    #   user = User.find_by_first_name("Steve")
    #   user.version # => 1
    #   user.skip_version do
    #     user.first_name = "Stephen"

    # Merging versions with the +merge_version+ block will take all of the versions that would

    # Appending versions with the +append_version+ block acts similarly to the +merge_version+
    # block in that all would-be version creations within the block are defered until the block
